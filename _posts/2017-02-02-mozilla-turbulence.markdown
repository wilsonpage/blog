This morning I found out that the part of *Mozilla* that I've be working within for the past year had collapsed.
A meeting was scheduled with HR for them to tell me my job is 'at risk'. In other words I have a few weeks
to find a something new.

### Joining Mozilla

In November 2013 I joined *Mozilla* to be part of *Firefox OS*. At the time it was the most ambitious
web project I'd ever seen. I felt closure after shipping a big project at the *Financial
Times* and jumped on the opportunity at *Mozilla*.

After countless interviews I got the news that I'd been offered the job. I was ecstatic.
As a young developer (26) I'd just landed my dream job.

I was constantly scared that my cover would be blown and, that someone would find out that I
wasn't good enough to be here. To circumvent this I gave everything I had. I was working
alongside some of the best web-developers in the world and the inventor
of JavaScript was at the helm ... what could be better?

### Veering off course

In 2014 following the media storm that hit his promotion, Brendan Eich left *Mozilla*.
Looking back, it felt like he took some of the magic with him; I think at this point *Mozilla* began to
drift off course.

The *Firefox OS* project was no longer a baby. We couldn't play that
card when people asked: "how many users have you got?". The product was a
valiant engineering accomplishment, but the user-value proposition was
fuzzy. We still couldn't answer the question: "why should I buy a Firefox OS phone?",
which was a clear red flag.

### The crash

In late 2015 it was announced that *Firefox OS* would be 'passed over to the community'
and that the team would be reborn as 'Connected Devices'. Our new task was product
innovation in the IoT space. We admitted *Firefox OS* was too late for the mobile market
but we were told we could be ahead of the curve for IoT.

At this point the team downsized; a lot of inspirational colleagues moved on to new things. I felt deflated and uninspired, but I used the opportunity to expand my knowledge, learning more about lower level systems.

Within my role in *Firefox OS* I was a professional at the top of my game. I attended
W3C standards meetings, spoke at conferences and on podcasts. Now I found myself
fumbling around in unfamiliar territory. It felt like going back to school.

### Repair

Something didn't feel right. My manager assured me that the team needed
me and kept me onboard. I embraced the situation and took on new roles. I read up
on new product development techniques and made use of my design skills to
communicate product ideas.

Eventually myself and some colleagues in London saw hope in a app concept we called
'Magnet'. It aimed to enhance real-life experiences by surfacing timely relevant
content.

I buried myself into *Project Magnet*, trying to ignore the low morale and
uninspiring projects in the rest of the organisation. I developed new engineering
skills in iOS and Android, and learnt a lot about product development.
Ignoring the temptation to build everything upfront and wrapping constraints
around ideas to make them feasible.

### Dead weight

Back in the day *Firefox OS* had to hire fast. As a result we may have pulled people
aboard too hastily. We clearly weren't all on the same wave length. *Mozilla* is
comfortable; sometimes people stay for the wrong reasons.

On top of this, we were burnt out. There's only so many times you can throw
people onto a new project and tell them to give it 110%. We endured failure,
we were being crushed by giant competitors, and that eventually ground
down even the strongest members.

### Next

Today Connected Devices is no more. I feel a strange feeling, like learning a close relative
that has been sick for a long time has passed away. There's both sadness and relief.

I'm a different person than I was the first day I walked into that shiny orange office in London,
giddy with excitement. I've travelled to parts of the world I never thought I'd see
and worked alongside some of the best.

I gave Mozilla everything I had. I pushed myself beyond my comfort zone
several times, which forces growth, but takes its toll on relationships.

**I'm about to turn thirty. It's a good time for me to take a step back and decide
what I want to achieve in the next few years.**
